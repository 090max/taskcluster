===================================================
Version     = '0.2.0'
Title       = 'Task Index API Documentation'
Description = 'The task index, typically available at `index.taskcluster.net`, is
responsible for indexing tasks. In order to ensure that tasks can be
located by recency and/or arbitrary strings. Common use-cases includes

 * Locate tasks by git or mercurial `<revision>`, or
 * Locate latest task from given `<branch>`, such as a release.

**Index hierarchy**, tasks are indexed in a dot `.` separated hierarchy
called a namespace. For example a task could be indexed in
`<revision>.linux-64.release-build`. In this case the following
namespaces is created.

 1. `<revision>`, and,
 2. `<revision>.linux-64`

The inside the namespace `<revision>` you can find the namespace
`<revision>.linux-64` inside which you can find the indexed task
`<revision>.linux-64.release-build`. In this example you'll be able to
find build for a given revision.

**Task Rank**, when a task is indexed, it is assigned a `rank` (defaults
to `0`). If another task is already indexed in the same namespace with
the same lower or equal `rank`, the task will be overwritten. For example
consider a task indexed as `mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build`, in
this case on might choose to use a unix timestamp or mercurial revision
number as `rank`. This way the latest completed linux 64 bit release
build is always available at `mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build`.

**Indexed Data**, when a task is located in the index you will get the
`taskId` and an additional user-defined JSON blob that was indexed with
task. You can use this to store additional information you would like to
get additional from the index.

**Entry Expiration**, all indexed entries must have an expiration date.
Typically this defaults to one year, if not specified. If you are
indexing tasks to make it easy to find artifacts, consider using the
expiration date that the artifacts is assigned.

**Indexing Routes**, tasks can be indexed using the API below, but the
most common way to index tasks is adding a custom route on the following
form `index.<namespace>`. In-order to add this route to a task you'll
need the following scope `queue:route:index.<namespace>`. When a task has
this route, it'll be indexed when the task is **completed successfully**.
The task will be indexed with `rank`, `data` and `expires` as specified
in `task.extra.index`, see example below:

```js
{
  payload:  { /* ... */ },
  routes: [
    // index.<namespace> prefixed routes, tasks CC'ed such a route will
    // be indexed under the given <namespace>
    "index.mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build",
    "index.<revision>.linux-64.release-build"
  ],
  extra: {
    // Optional details for indexing service
    index: {
      // Ordering, this taskId will overwrite any thing that has
      // rank <= 4000 (defaults to zero)
      rank:       4000,

      // Specify when the entries expires (Defaults to 1 year)
      expires:          new Date().toJSON(),

      // A little informal data to store along with taskId
      // (less 16 kb when encoded as JSON)
      data: {
        hgRevision:   "...",
        commitMessae: "...",
        whatever...
      }
    },
    // Extra properties for other services...
  }
  // Other task properties...
}
```

**Remark**, when indexing tasks using custom routes, it's also possible
to listen for messages about these tasks. Which is quite convenient, for
example one could bind to `route.index.mozilla-central.*.release-build`,
and pick up all messages about release builds. Hence, it is a
good idea to document task index hierarchies, as these make up extension
points in their own.'

    Entry Description = 'This API end-point creates an artifact for a specific run of a task. This
should **only** be used by a worker currently operating on this task, or
from a process running within the task (ie. on the worker).

All artifacts must specify when they `expires`, the queue will
automatically take care of deleting artifacts past their
expiration point. This features makes it feasible to upload large
intermediate artifacts from data processing applications, as the
artifacts can be set to expire a few days later.

We currently support 4 different `storageType`s, each storage type have
slightly different features and in some cases difference semantics.

**S3 artifacts**, is useful for static files which will be stored on S3.
When creating an S3 artifact is create the queue will return a pre-signed
URL to which you can do a `PUT` request to upload your artifact. Note
that `PUT` request **must** specify the `content-length` header and
**must** give the `content-type` header the same value as in the request
to `createArtifact`.

**Azure artifacts**, are stored in _Azure Blob Storage_ service, which
given the consistency guarantees and API interface offered by Azure is
more suitable for artifacts that will be modified during the execution
of the task. For example docker-worker has a feature that persists the
task log to Azure Blob Storage every few seconds creating a somewhat
live log. A request to create an Azure artifact will return a URL
featuring a [Shared-Access-Signature](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn140256.aspx),
refer to MSDN for further information on how to use these.

**Reference artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will
store for you. These artifacts really only have a `url` property and
when the artifact is requested the client will be redirect the URL
provided with a `303` (See Other) redirect. Please note that we cannot
delete artifacts you upload to other service, we can only delete the
reference to the artifact, when it expires.

**Error artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will
store for you. These artifacts are only meant to indicate that you the
worker or the task failed to generate a specific artifact, that you
would otherwise have uploaded. For example docker-worker will upload an
error artifact, if the file it was supposed to upload doesn't exists or
turns out to be a directory. Clients requesting an error artifact will
get a `403` (Forbidden) response. This is mainly designed to ensure that
dependent tasks can distinguish between artifacts that were suppose to
be generated and artifacts for which the name is misspelled.

**Artifact immutability**, generally speaking you cannot overwrite an
artifact when created. But if you repeat the request with the same
properties the request will succeed as the operation is idempotent.
This is useful if you need to refresh a signed URL while uploading.
Do not abuse this to overwrite artifacts created by another entity!
Such as worker-host overwriting artifact created by worker-code.

As a special case the `url` property on _reference artifacts_ can be
updated. You should only use this to update the `url` property for
reference artifacts your process has created.'

=========================================================
Version         = '0.2.0'
Title           = 'Queue AMQP Exchanges'
Description     = 'The queue, typically available at `queue.taskcluster.net`, is responsible
for accepting tasks and track their state as they are executed by
workers. In order ensure they are eventually resolved.

This document describes AMQP exchanges offered by the queue, which allows
third-party listeners to monitor tasks as they progress to resolution.
These exchanges targets the following audience:
 * Schedulers, who takes action after tasks are completed,
 * Workers, who wants to listen for new or canceled tasks (optional),
 * Tools, that wants to update their view as task progress.

You'll notice that all the exchanges in the document shares the same
routing key pattern. This makes it very easy to bind to all messages
about a certain kind tasks.

**Task-graphs**, if the task-graph scheduler, documented elsewhere, is
used to schedule a task-graph, the task submitted will have their
`schedulerId` set to `'task-graph-scheduler'`, and their `taskGroupId` to
the `taskGraphId` as given to the task-graph scheduler. This is useful if
you wish to listen for all messages in a specific task-graph.

**Task specific routes**, a task can define a task specific route using
the `task.routes` property. See task creation documentation for details
on permissions required to provide task specific routes. If a task has
the entry `'notify.by-email'` in as task specific route defined in
`task.routes` all messages about this task will be CC'ed with the
routing-key `'route.notify.by-email'`.

These routes will always be prefixed `route.`, so that cannot interfere
with the _primary_ routing key as documented here. Notice that the
_primary_ routing key is alwasys prefixed `primary.`. This is ensured
in the routing key reference, so API clients will do this automatically.

Please, note that the way RabbitMQ works, the message will only arrive
in your queue once, even though you may have bound to the exchange with
multiple routing key patterns that matches more of the CC'ed routing
routing keys.

**Delivery guarantees**, most operations on the queue are idempotent,
which means that if repeated with the same arguments then the requests
will ensure completion of the operation and return the same response.
This is useful if the server crashes or the TCP connection breaks, but
when re-executing an idempotent operation, the queue will also resend
any related AMQP messages. Hence, messages may be repeated.

This shouldn't be much of a problem, as the best you can achieve using
confirm messages with AMQP is at-least-once delivery semantics. Hence,
this only prevents you from obtaining at-most-once delivery semantics.

**Remark**, some message generated by timeouts maybe dropped if the
server crashes at wrong time. Ideally, we'll address this in the
future. For now we suggest you ignore this corner case, and notify us
if this corner case is of concern to you.'

This means that the actual artifact is rarely available when this message
is posted. But it is not unreasonable to assume that the artifact will
will become available at some point later. Most signatures will expire in
30 minutes or so, forcing the uploader to call `createArtifact` with
the same payload again in-order to continue uploading the artifact.

However, in most cases (especially for small artifacts) it's very
reasonable assume the artifact will be available within a few minutes.
This property means that this exchange is mostly useful for tools
monitoring task evaluation. One could also use it count number of
artifacts per task, or _index_ artifacts though in most cases it'll be
smarter to index artifacts after the task in question have completed
successfully.'

satisfied.

This document describes API end-points offered by the task-graph
scheduler. These end-points targets the following audience:
 * Post-commit hooks, that wants to submit task-graphs for testing,
 * End-users, who wants to execute a set of dependent tasks, and
 * Tools, that wants to inspect the state of a task-graph.'

    Entry Description = 'Create a new task-graph, the `status` of the resulting JSON is a
task-graph status structure, you can find the `taskGraphId` in this
structure.

**Referencing required tasks**, it is possible to reference other tasks
in the task-graph that must be completed successfully before a task is
scheduled. You just specify the `taskId` in the list of `required` tasks.
See the example below, where the second task requires the first task.
```js
{
  ...
  tasks: [
    {
      taskId:     "XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA",
      requires:   [],
      ...
    },
    {
      taskId:     "73GsfK62QNKAk2Hg1EEZTQ",
      requires:   ["XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA"],
      task: {
        payload: {
          env: {
            DEPENDS_ON:  "XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA"
          }
          ...
        }
        ...
      },
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**The `schedulerId` property**, defaults to the `schedulerId` of this
scheduler in production that is `"task-graph-scheduler"`. This
property must be either undefined or set to `"task-graph-scheduler"`,
otherwise the task-graph will be rejected.

**The `taskGroupId` property**, defaults to the `taskGraphId` of the
task-graph submitted, and if provided much be the `taskGraphId` of
the task-graph. Otherwise the task-graph will be rejected.

**Task-graph scopes**, a task-graph is assigned a set of scopes, just
like tasks. Tasks within a task-graph cannot have scopes beyond those
the task-graph has. The task-graph scheduler will execute all requests
on behalf of a task-graph using the set of scopes assigned to the
task-graph. Thus, if you are submitting tasks to `my-worker-type` under
`my-provisioner` it's important that your task-graph has the scope
required to define tasks for this `provisionerId` and `workerType`.
See the queue for details on permissions required. Note, the task-graph
does not require permissions to schedule the tasks. This is done with
scopes provided by the task-graph scheduler.

**Task-graph specific routing-keys**, using the `taskGraph.routes`
property you may define task-graph specific routing-keys. If a task-graph
has a task-graph specific routing-key: `<route>`, then the poster will
be required to posses the scope `scheduler:route:<route>`. And when the
an AMQP message about the task-graph is published the message will be
CC'ed with the routing-key: `route.<route>`. This is useful if you want
another component to listen for completed tasks you have posted.'

all `taskId`s within the task-graph.

task-graph being modified is still running. If the task-graph is

Title           = 'Scheduler AMQP Exchanges'
Description     = 'The scheduler, typically available at `scheduler.taskcluster.net` is
responsible for accepting task-graphs and schedule tasks on the queue as
their dependencies are completed successfully.

This document describes the AMQP exchanges offered by the scheduler,
which allows third-party listeners to monitor task-graph submission and
resolution. These exchanges targets the following audience:
 * Reporters, who displays the state of task-graphs or emails people on
   failures, and
 * End-users, who wants notification of completed task-graphs

**Remark**, the task-graph scheduler will require that the `schedulerId`
for tasks is set to the `schedulerId` for the task-graph scheduler. In
production the `schedulerId` is typically `"task-graph-scheduler"`.
Furthermore, the task-graph scheduler will also require that
`taskGroupId` is equal to the `taskGraphId`.

Combined these requirements ensures that `schedulerId` and `taskGroupId`
have the same position in the routing keys for the queue exchanges.
See queue documentation for details on queue exchanges. Hence, making
it easy to listen for all tasks in a given task-graph.

Note that routing key entries 2 through 7 used for exchanges on the
task-graph scheduler is hardcoded to `_`. This is done to preserve
positional equivalence with exchanges offered by the queue.'

      the task. You will need to parse the XML reponse and base64 decode and
      JSON parse the `MessageText`, also note that `claimTask` requires
      the `PopReceipt` and `MessageId`.
      **Remark**, you are allowed to append `&numofmessages=N`, where N < 32,
      to the URLs if you wish to obtain more than one message at the time.
