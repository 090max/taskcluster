---
The artifact types `blob` and `azure` are no longer supported.  Neither of these types has seen real use, and both are broken in all known deployments of Taskcluster.

The [Object Service](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1471582) will implement much of the same functionality, but likely with subtle differences.  Removing these unused artifact types now will simplify migration to the Object Service once it is developed.
