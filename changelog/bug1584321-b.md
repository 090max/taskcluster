Scopes for the Taskcluster services themselves are now handled internally to the platform, although access tokens must still be managed as part of the deployment process.
When deploying this version, remove all `scopes` and `description` properties from `static/taskcluster/..` clients in the array in the Auth service's `STATIC_CLIENTS` configuration.
See [the new docs on static clients](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/deploying/static-clients) for more background on this setting.
