Taskcluster deployments now support sentry error reporting. You can configure this option by setting
an `errorConfig` at the top-level of your config:

```
rootUrl: ...
errorConfig:
  reporter: SentryReporter
  dsn: <your sentry dsn>
```

Errors will be reported to this project and tagged with service/process names in addition to taskcluster
release version.
