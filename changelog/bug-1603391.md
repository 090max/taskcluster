Worker Pool `config` properties now must match one (or more) of the provider json schemas. Previously, config object of a Worker Pool definition was not validated for conformance to any of the provider json schemas. This resulted in limited information being provided in the createWorkerPool api reference documentation, and no go types being generated in the go client to represent the various config provider data structures.
