[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) notifications are now supported if a deployment is configured
with credentials for a homeserver. The three fields needed are:

```yaml
notify.matrix_base_url: foo # The homeserver where your client is registered
notify.matrix_user_id: bar # The user that will act on behalf of taskcluster
notify.matrix_access_token: baz # An access token for this user
```

If you are using riot, you can get the access token by following [this guide](https://t2bot.io/docs/access_tokens/).
