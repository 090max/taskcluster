---
The `auth.gcpCredentials` method no longer modifies the *granting* service account.
Instead, that service account must be configured with the "Service Account Token Creator" role prior to deployment of Taskcluster.
The format of configuration for these credentials has changed as well, now taking `GCP_CREDENTIALS_ALLOWED_PROJECTS`.
See the deployment documentation for more information.
