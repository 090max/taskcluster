---
The maximum "deadline" has been reverted to 5 days, after its change to 10 days in v24.1.3.  Values over 7 days caused internal server errors anyway, because the Azure queue backend cannot handle delays greater than that value.  Since this functionality never worked, the revert is considered minor.
