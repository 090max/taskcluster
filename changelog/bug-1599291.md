reference: bug 1599291
---
Added logging around worker provisioning logic to keep better track of workers.

* `worker-requested`, `worker-running`, `worker-stopped` are all three new log messages
  that allow you to track the lifecycle of workers
* `scan-seen` reports on the state of the world that the worker-scanner
  has observed on each run
* `simple-estimator` messages now have an error status if `runningCapacity` is greater
   than `maxCapacity`. This state occurs due to a bug in worker-manager and should be
   reported to the taskcluster team if it occurs
*  This state will also report an error to a configured error reporter if you have one.
