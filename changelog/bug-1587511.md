Worker pools that use cloud providers (aws, azure, google) now support a `lifecycle.reregisterTimeout` config that
will make the credentials we hand to these workers expire within that amount of seconds. If the worker still exists
at that time, the instance will be terminated. This lays the groundwork for a subsequent release where you will
be able to have your workers reregister to continue working.
