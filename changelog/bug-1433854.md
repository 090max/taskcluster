---
Task directories from previous task runs on Windows are now more aggressively
purged.

This should reduce the amount of time spent trying to delete task directories
between task runs, and also the amount of logging, in addition to freeing up
more disk space.

This issue always existed on the Windows version of generic-worker. A similar
issue existed on macOS and Linux but was fixed in bug 1615312 which was
initially tagged for release in v25.0.0, but first appeared in release 25.3.0
due to some problems with the release process.
