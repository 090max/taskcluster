---
Credentials for the `auth.awsS3Credentials` method are no longer specified in Helm properties `auth.aws_access_key_id`, `auth.aws_secret_access_key`, and `auth.aws_region`.  Instead this information is now configured in `auth.aws_credentials_allowed_buckets` as described in [the deployment docs](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/deploying/cloud-credentials).  The region is no longer required, but the configuration must now include a list of supported buckets.  For a quick update, set `auth.aws_credentials_allowed_buckets` to `[{"accessKeyId": "<access_key_id>", "secretAccessKey": "<secret_access_key>", "buckets": ["<bucket_name>"]}]`.
