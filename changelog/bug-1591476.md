---
worker-manager's `registerWorker()` now returns worker config, and worker-runner (for Azure and static providers, others coming soon) merges that configuration with other configuration sources.  This allows worker pools to include configuration for static workers, and allows Azure workers to fetch their config without referencing the non-functional customData instance metadata.
