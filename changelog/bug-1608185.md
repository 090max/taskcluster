Taskcluster-worker-runner now passes `--with-worker-runner` to generic-worker when running it directly.  When running generic-worker as a Windows service, this argument should be included in the service definition.

Only generic-worker versions 25.0.0 and higher support this argument.  In general, we recommend running matching versions of taskcluster-worker-runner and generic-worker.
