Taskcluster logs now include `traceId` and `requestId` fields on messages that have these in context.
A `requestId` is per http request and a `traceId` follows a request chain along as far as it goes so
for example a graphql request to web-server -> queue -> auth.authenticateHawk are all correlatable
as part of one trace.

As part of this change, by default in Kubernetes, requests between services are now routed directly using
Kubernetes dns service discovery. To disable this, you can set the top-level `useKubernetesDnsServiceDiscovery`
to `false` in your helm values.
