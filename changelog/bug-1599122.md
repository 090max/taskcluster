Worker Manager now does a better job at keeping provisioning in-sync with reality.

* Workers now have a top-level `capacity` field which is how many tasks it can run at once.
* Workers now have `lastModified` and `lastChecked` fields which are useful for determining
  the state the worker is actually in vs what state Taskcluster thinks it is in.
* When calling `createWorker` manually, you can now specify a capacity for the worker.
