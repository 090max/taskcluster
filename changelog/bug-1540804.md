Config property `publicIP` of generic-worker workers is now optional. When not
provided, rdp into Windows workers will no longer be possible, Chain of Trust
environment reports will no longer include the public IP, and livelogs via
stateless dns server will no longer work (however this will not affect livelog
served over websocktunnel).
