Generic worker is now shipped as part of the taskcluster platform release. The generic-worker codebase has been integrated into the monorepo. The former generic-worker github repo is now archived.

Consequently, the generic worker version number now matches the taskcluster platform release number.

The generic-worker binaries are published to https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases.
