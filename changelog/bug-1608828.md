Generic worker is now shipped as part of the taskcluster platform release. The generic-worker codebase has been integrated into the monorepo. The former generic-worker github repo is now archived.  Consequently, the generic worker version number now matches the taskcluster platform release number.  The generic-worker binaries are published to https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases.

With this change, the import path for the Taskcluster Go client library changes from `github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/clients/client-go/vNN` to `github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/vNN/clients/client-go`.  Functionality of the library remains unchanged.
