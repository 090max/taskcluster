---
Old generic-worker task directories on POSIX systems (Linux/macOS) are now
deleted more aggressively, by first running `chmod u+w -R <task dir>` before
running `rm -rf <task dir>`.

This bug always existed, and could leave files on the filesystem from previous
tasks. Those files were not readable to other task users under the
generic-worker multiuser engine where they were owned by a different OS user,
but they did consume disk space. The files were readable by other tasks under
the generic-worker simple engine, where all tasks run as the same user, but
simple engine is not used for tasks that contain sensitive/private information.

This bug was present in both the simple and multisuer engine, and has been
fixed on both.

Cleanup of Windows task directories will be handled separately in [bug
1433854](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433854).
