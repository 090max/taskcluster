The Azure worker-manager provider now provides bootstrapping information to the worker in tags in addition to the `customData` instance metadata field, and worker-runner now expects to find data in tags.  This avoids the use of the barely-functional customData.  Reading this information from customData is now deprecated, but will continue to work at least until the next major Taskcluster release.
