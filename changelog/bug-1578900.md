* Worker Manager AWS Provider now requires the `ec2:DescribeRegions` permission in addition to the previous permissions.
  The full permissions set is documented in the  deploying workers section of the manual.
* Worker Manager AWS Provider now uses all the configs from the array of `launchConfigs` worker pools use, rather than a
  single, randomly selected config. This allows per-region and per-zone resources to be specified. MinCapacity and 
  MaxCapacity are now specified for the whole worker pool as opposed to for every individual config.

```diff
some/worker:
  config:
    minCapacity: 25
    maxCapacity: 50
-   regions: [us-central1, ...]
-   capacityPerInstance: 1
-   ...
+   launchConfigs:
+     - region: us-central1
+       capacityPerInstance: 1
+       ...
```
