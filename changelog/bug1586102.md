The github service now adds scopes for check/status scopes and its scheduler-id, where previously it had relied on specific configuration of the `repo:github.com/*` role.
This has no user-visible change, but is a breaking change for deployments: the following scopes must be added to the github service's static client on deployment:

- `queue:scheduler-id:taskcluster-github`
- `queue:route:statuses`
- `queue:route:checks`
