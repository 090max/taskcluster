This features makes it feasible to upload large\nintermediate artifacts from data processing applications, as the\nartifacts can be set to expire a few days later.\n\nWe currently support 4 different `storageType`s, each storage type have\nslightly different features and in some cases difference semantics.\n\n**S3 artifacts**, is useful for static files which will be stored on S3.\nWhen creating an S3 artifact is create the queue will return a pre-signed\nURL to which you can do a `PUT` request to upload your artifact. Note\nthat `PUT` request **must** specify the `content-length` header and\n**must** give the `content-type` header the same value as in the request\nto `createArtifact`.\n\n**Azure artifacts**, are stored in _Azure Blob Storage_ service, which\ngiven the consistency guarantees and API interface offered by Azure is\nmore suitable for artifacts that will be modified during the execution\nof the task. For example docker-worker has a feature that persists the\ntask log to Azure Blob Storage every few seconds creating a somewhat\nlive log. A request to create an Azure artifact will return a URL\nfeaturing a [Shared-Access-Signature](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn140256.aspx),\nrefer to MSDN for further information on how to use these.\n\n**Reference artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will\nstore for you. These artifacts really only have a `url` property and\nwhen the artifact is requested the client will be redirect the URL\nprovided with a `303` (See Other) redirect. Please note that we cannot\ndelete artifacts you upload to other service, we can only delete the\nreference to the artifact, when it expires.\n\n**Error artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will\nstore for you. These artifacts are only meant to indicate that you the\nworker or the task failed to generate a specific artifact, that you\nwould otherwise have uploaded. For example docker-worker will upload an\nerror artifact, if the file it was supposed to upload doesn't exists or\nturns out to be a directory. Clients requesting an error artifact will\nget a `403` (Forbidden) response. This is mainly designed to ensure that\ndependent tasks can distinguish between artifacts that were suppose to\nbe generated and artifacts for which the name is misspelled.\n\n**Artifact immutability**, generally speaking you cannot overwrite an\nartifact when created. But if you repeat the request with the same\nproperties the request will succeed as the operation is idempotent.\nThis is useful if you need to refresh a signed URL while uploading.\nDo not abuse this to overwrite artifacts created by another entity!\nSuch as worker-host overwriting artifact created by worker-code.\n\nAs a special case the `url` property on _reference artifacts_ can be\nupdated. You should only use this to update the `url` property for\nreference artifacts your process has created.",
