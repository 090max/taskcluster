# Development Documentation

This directory contains general information useful for people working on the Taskcluster codebase.
It should be used in concert with the READMEs for the services and libraries, and of course examination of the code itself.

The [Taskcluster monorepo](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster) on Github contains the source code for all of the microservices, a collection of supporting libraries, and more.

## RFCs

Taskcluster manages major changes to the platform through "requests for comment", known as RFCs.
These provide an open, transparent decision-making process and a way to track ideas from initial proposal through decision and implementation.

Taskcluster's RFCs are in the [taskcluster-rfcs repository](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs).
