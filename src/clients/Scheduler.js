  // Create a new task-graph, the `status` of the resulting JSON is a

  // structure.
  // **Referencing required tasks**, it is possible to reference other tasks
  // in the task-graph that must be completed successfully before a task is
  // scheduled. You just specify the `taskId` in the list of `required` tasks.
  // See the example below, where the second task requires the first task.
  // ```js
  // {
  //   ...
  //   tasks: [
  //     {
  //       taskId:     "XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA",
  //       requires:   [],
  //       ...
  //     },
  //     {
  //       taskId:     "73GsfK62QNKAk2Hg1EEZTQ",
  //       requires:   ["XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA"],
  //       task: {
  //         payload: {

  // **The `schedulerId` property**, defaults to the `schedulerId` of this
  // scheduler in production that is `"task-graph-scheduler"`. This
  // property must be either undefined or set to `"task-graph-scheduler"`,
  // otherwise the task-graph will be rejected.
  // **The `taskGroupId` property**, defaults to the `taskGraphId` of the
  // task-graph submitted, and if provided much be the `taskGraphId` of
  // the task-graph. Otherwise the task-graph will be rejected.
  // **Task-graph scopes**, a task-graph is assigned a set of scopes, just
  // like tasks. Tasks within a task-graph cannot have scopes beyond those
  // the task-graph has. The task-graph scheduler will execute all requests
  // on behalf of a task-graph using the set of scopes assigned to the
  // task-graph. Thus, if you are submitting tasks to `my-worker-type` under
  // `my-provisioner` it's important that your task-graph has the scope
  // required to define tasks for this `provisionerId` and `workerType`.
  // (`queue:define-task:..` or `queue:create-task:..`; see the queue for
  // details on scopes required). Note, the task-graph does not require
  // permissions to schedule the tasks (`queue:schedule-task:..`), as this is
  // done with scopes provided by the task-graph scheduler.
  // **Task-graph specific routing-keys**, using the `taskGraph.routes`
  // property you may define task-graph specific routing-keys. If a task-graph
  // has a task-graph specific routing-key: `<route>`, then the poster will
  // be required to posses the scope `scheduler:route:<route>`. And when the
  // an AMQP message about the task-graph is published the message will be
  // CC'ed with the routing-key: `route.<route>`. This is useful if you want
  // another component to listen for completed tasks you have posted.
