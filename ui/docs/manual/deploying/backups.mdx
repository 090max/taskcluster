# Backups and Restores

Taskcluster stores data such as the following in its backend database:

 * all runtime configuration such as clients, roles, hooks, worker pools
 * stored status such as worker status and errors
 * task metadata including task definitions and status

Notably, the database does *not* include Task artifacts.
Artifacts are generally too large to practically back up.

We recommend using standard Postgres backup tools to capture periodic backups of the Taskcluster configuration.
Most cloud deployments of Postgres include backup facilities, and there are several well-known solutions available for standalone deployments of the software.

Note that we recommend Taskcluster administrators use a tool such as [tc-admin](https://github.com/taskcluster/tc-admin) to control resources on a deployment.
Such tools can also serve as a secondary backup mechanism, able to quickly restore the runtime configuration, but not addressing task and worker status.
In cases where it's acceptable to lose tasks and workers, such a tool may be a sufficient disaster-recovery mechanism.
