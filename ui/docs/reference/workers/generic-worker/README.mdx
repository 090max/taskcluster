# Generic Worker

Generic-Worker is a worker for Taskcluster, designed to run arbitrary tasks on a wide range of platforms.
While Taskcluster supports many worker implementations as long as they follow the [Queue-Worker interaction process](/docs/reference/platform/queue/worker-interaction), Generic-Worker is the common choice for most worker pools.

This documentation is a work in progress.
